#SpicyTwitchIRC (Soon to be known as just SpicyTwitch
A simple Python module for communicating with twitch chat via IRC.

## Is it stable?
Not just yet. It's been some time since I last updated it, recently had it crash
on me.

## Can I use this?
Go ahead, just know that it's still in development and will have many changes as
I continue to develop it. I'm also rather new to developing software at this
scale (I'm developing this for use in a Twitch Bot) so you might find some code
that you feel could be done better.

## Any big plans?
I intend to turn this into a full-blwon package for building twitch bots. I'm
unsure if this is something I'll be continuing to support for years to come, but
for the time being it is my main project.
