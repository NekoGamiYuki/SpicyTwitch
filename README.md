#SpicyTwitchIRC
A simple Python module for communicating with twitch chat via IRC.

## Is it stable?
Not just yet. It's been some time since I last updated it, recently had it crash on me.
I'm currently going through and fixing everything up, starting with the way it parses chat.

## The code is so bad...
I know, which is why I'm currently rewriting it.
