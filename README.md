#SpicyTwitchIRC (Soon to be known as just SpicyTwitch)
A simple Python module for communicating with twitch chat via IRC.

## Is it stable?
Not just yet.

## Can I use this?
Go ahead, just know that it's still in development and will have many changes as
I continue to develop it. I'm also rather new to developing software at this
scale (I'm developing this for use in a Twitch Bot) so you might find some code
that you feel could be done better.

## Why is it using 'sfh' emotes?
Because it was developed primarily for the purpose of being a bot in sly's
channel. I'm working on a set of basic emotes that the command modules can use
and a bot can quickly alter. That way changing emotes won't have to be tedious.

## Any big plans?
I intend to turn this into a full-blown package for building twitch bots. I'm
unsure if this is something I'll be continuing to support for years to come, but
for the time being it is my main project.
